# Skill Recommendation System

This is a Skill Recommendation System built using Streamlit, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The app provides course recommendations based on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and a hybrid approach combining both methods. The dataset used here is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azraimohamad/coursera-course-data?select=coursera_course_dataset_v2_no_null.csv

Please Note that this is not complete and I am in process of incorporating Deeplearning in this project. Also, there are some errors for few courses. I will be updating the scripts soon.
